# VBA-Challenge
I used a combination of Study Groups, Tutoring, Expert Learning Assistant, and ChatGPT to help me accomplish this project.
I used expert learning assistant throughout to help me understand when code wasnt running correctly, how to get started tackling something
The Tutor helped me restructure my entire code so it made more sense as far as flow, he also helped me account for zeros in calculations. 
I used Study Group Peer help with general structure and Code for the conditional color formatting, and for putting in headers
I used Chat GPT after trying study group and expert learning Assistant to figure out how to calculate and populate the chart. I was able to use code and principals from there to help me build my own code to meet the needs I had.
